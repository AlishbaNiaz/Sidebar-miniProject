# CSS Grid Page Layout

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a **page layout** using **CSS Grid**.  
It includes the following sections:
- **Header**
- **Sidebar**
- **Navigation**
- **Ads**
- **Main Content**
- **Footer**

The layout is managed entirely with CSS Grid for clean and responsive positioning.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- **grid.html** â€” Contains the HTML structure of the page.
- **grid.css** â€” Contains the CSS styling and grid layout definitions.

---

## ðŸ›  How It Works
1. The `#grid` container is set as a **CSS Grid**.
2. Grid areas are defined for:
   - `HEADER` (`#one`)
   - `SIDE BAR` (`#two`)
   - `NAVIGATION` (`#three`)
   - `ADS` (`#four`)
   - `MAIN` (`#five`)
   - `FOOTER` (`#six`)
3. Each section is styled individually and placed according to the grid layout.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Download or clone the project.
2. Ensure `grid.html` and `grid.css` are in the same directory.
3. Open `grid.html` in your web browser.
